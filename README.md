  <p align="center">
    We wanted to literally take notation out of the hands of veterinajry professionals, and put clients money where their pets' doctor's mouth is...OK, that's a bit of a stretch.
<br />
PSH enables not just keeping of medical documentation, but the oral dictation, all in one database which is convenient for both the veterinary staff and the pet owner.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Pet Speak Health (PSH) enables the storage of medical notes, history, and other relevant medical records specific to a pet and their owner. Pet Speak Health uses STT (Speech to Text) notation for when your hands are occupied caring for a per. Medical record transcription takes the pen out of your hands so you can focus on what is really important... caring for the animals! When activated, PSH records audio and will transcribe
your notes and store them to a pet's unique file the server. The pet's records are unique to each client ie: owner. Medical records are accessible to the staff, as well as the owner.
